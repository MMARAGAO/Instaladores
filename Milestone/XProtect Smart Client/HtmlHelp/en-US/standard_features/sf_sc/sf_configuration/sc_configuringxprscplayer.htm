          <p>A project in <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SCplayer_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client – Player</span> is a collection of files that are created when video is exported in database format from <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SC_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client</span>. Your user settings, including information about your views, are stored as part of a project.</p>
          <p>The <span class="uitext">Project</span> pane appears when you click <span class="uitext">Setup</span>. In setup mode, you can:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Change the name of the project.</li>
            <li>Create or open a project</li>
            <li>Assign passwords to projects - only people with permission can view a video. You can also assign passwords to devices when you export them. To avoid having to keep track of several database passwords, you can assign a single password to the overall project. If you do not assign an overall password and you have databases with passwords added to your project, you will be asked to enter a password for each database when you open the project. If you assign a password to a project, you cannot delete it. However, you can change the password or create a new identical project in the <span class="uitext">Project</span> pane.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Digital signatures (explained)<a name="SC_VerifyingTheAuthentic.htm"></a></h2>
        <div>
          <p class="note">This feature is only available in certain <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.XP variable">XProtect</span> VMS systems. For information about the features in your system, see <a href="../sf_considerationsrequirements/sc_surveillancesystemdif.htm" class="MCXref xref">Surveillance system differences</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You can use digital signatures to verify the authenticity of your recorded video. This is useful, for example if you want to demonstrate that the video has not been tampered with.</p>
        <p>There are two stages of verification. You can verify:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>whether the video has been modified after it was recorded. The recording server creates a digital signature for the recording. Later when you view exported video in <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SCplayer_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client – Player</span>, you can compare the recording signature with the one that was originally created by the recording server.</li>
          <li>whether video that you export in <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SC_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client</span> has been modified after it was exported. During the export process, <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SC_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client</span> creates a signature for the export file. Later when you review the exported evidence in <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SCplayer_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client – Player</span>, you can compare the export signature with the one that was created during the export.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you find that there is a discrepancy, there is reason to question the reliability of the video evidence.</p>
        <p>The original digital signatures are contained in the <span class="specialbold">PublicKey.xml</span> and <span class="specialbold">Public Key Certificate.xml</span> files in these locations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SC_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client</span> - <span class="specialbold">&lt;export destination folder&gt;\&lt;export name&gt;\Client Files\Data\Mediadata\&lt;camera name&gt;\&lt;camera name&gt;\Export signatures</span></li>
          <li>
            <span class="mc-variable flvar-sw-component.MC_XP variable">XProtect Management Client</span> - <span class="specialbold">C:\Program Files\<span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.CompanyShort variable">Milestone</span>\Management Server\Tools\CertificateIssuer</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are two scenarios where digital signatures are excluded during the export process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If there are areas with <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Glossary.Term55">privacy masks<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A blurred or solid color that covers an area of the video in the camera view. The defined areas are blurred or covered in live, playback, hotspot, carousel, smart map, smart search, and export modes in the clients.</span></a>, digital signatures for the recording server will be removed in the export.</li>
          <li>If the data you are exporting is very close to the current date and time, the digital signature for the recording server might not be included for the whole sequence. In this case, only part of the export will have digital signatures added.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The export process will complete, but when you verify the signatures, you will see that the digital signatures for the recording server were removed or partially OK.</p>
