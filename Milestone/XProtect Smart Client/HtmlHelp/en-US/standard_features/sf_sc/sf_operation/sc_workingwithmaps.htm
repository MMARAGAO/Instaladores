      <h1>Maps (usage)</h1>
      <p class="note">If you are connected to a surveillance system that supports <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.FedArch variable">Milestone Federated Architecture</span>, you can only add maps from the surveillance system server you logged in to.<br /></p>
      <div>
        <h2>Maps (explained)<a name="SC_IntroductionToMaps(796).htm"></a></h2>
        <p>With a map, you get a physical overview of your surveillance system. You can instantly see which cameras are placed where, and in what direction they are pointing. You can use maps for navigation. Maps can be grouped into hierarchies, so you can drill down through hot zones, from large perspectives to detailed perspectives, for example, from city level to street level, or from building level to room level.</p>
        <p>A map position does not display live video, a map is always a still image.</p>
        <p>Maps may contain elements representing cameras, microphones, and similar technology. You can view recorded video from cameras in a preview window when you move your mouse over a camera icon on the map. The status information in playback mode is <span class="specialbold">not</span> based on recorded data, but retrieved from the elements' current status, as displayed in live mode.</p>

        <p>Map with camera elements and hot zone</p>
        <p>Maps do not have to be geographical maps, although they often are. Depending on your organization's needs, photos and other kinds of image files can also be used as maps.</p>
        <p class="note">Maps are not the same as a smart map. For more information, see <a href="../../../feature_flags/ff_map/sc_configuringmaps.htm#SC_DifferencesBetweenMap.htm" class="MCXref xref">Differences between maps and smart maps (explained)</a>.</p>

        <h2>How elements interact with maps<a name="SC_HowElementsInteraWithMaps.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>You can use map elements to interact with the actual devices in the following ways:</p>
        <div class="MCDropDown MCDropDown_Closed dropDown">
          <span class="MCDropDownHead dropDownHead">
            <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCDropDownHotSpot dropDownHotspot MCDropDownHotSpot_ MCHotSpotImage" aria-expanded="false">
              <img class="MCDropDown_Image_Icon" src="../../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif" height="11" width="16" alt="Closed" data-mc-alt2="Open" />Cameras </a>
          </span>
          <div class="MCDropDownBody dropDownBody">
            <p>Place your mouse pointer over a camera on a map to see a live preview from the camera. Click the title bar of the preview to display it as a separate floating window. You can resize the floating window by pulling its corners. To start recording, right-click the required camera and select <span class="uitext">Start recording for # minutes</span>. Particular user rights may be required to use this feature.</p>
            <p>A <span class="specialbold">fixed camera</span> is displayed on the map with an associated view zone that shows the camera's angle of view. Note that the angle on the map is very likely to need adjustment to match the camera's angle of view. To adjust the angle, simply drag it to a suitable size and position.</p>
            <p>A <span class="specialbold">PTZ camera</span> is displayed on the map with any PTZ presets defined for the camera on the surveillance system. The presets are illustrated as colored angles that radiate from the PTZ camera icon. Each angle represents a particular preset. Note that the angles are very likely to need adjustment to match the camera's preset angles. To adjust an angle, simply drag it to a suitable size and position. If a camera has more than 25 presets, no angles are initially displayed since the angles would be too small to be useful. In such cases, you can add required angles individually by dragging the presets from the required camera from the <span class="uitext">Element selector</span> window onto the map. To go to one of a PTZ camera's presets, simply click the preset on the map. This works in the floating preview window, on the map itself, as well as in hotspot positions (see <a href="sc_workingwithnavelements.htm#SC_HotspotsExplained.htm" class="MCXref xref">Hotspots (explained)</a>). Alternatively, right-click the camera, select <span class="uitext">PTZ presets</span>, then select the required preset.</p>

Because user rights can be time-based, you might not be able to access a map that you could previously. This can be because you do not have access during certain hours of the day or certain days of the week. Contact your system administrator if in doubt about your user rights.</p>

        <h2>Map overview window (explained)<a name="SC_TheMapOverviewWindow.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>The <span class="uitext">Map overview</span> window provides you with an overview of the map hierarchy set up in the <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SC_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client</span>. To open the <span class="uitext">Map overview</span> window, right-click the map and select <span class="uitext">Map overview</span> or click the icon <img src="../../../../Images/the_map_overview_window.png" alt="" /> on the map title bar.</p>
        <p>A plus sign (+) next to a map indicates that the map could have one or more sub-maps attached to it as hot zones. Clicking a map in the <span class="uitext">Map overview</span> immediately displays the selected map in the view.</p>
        <div>
          <p class="note">Content in the <span class="uitext">Map overview</span> may take some time to load if you are connected to a very large surveillance system with many maps.</p>
          <p class="note">If you are connected to a surveillance system that supports <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.FedArch variable">Milestone Federated Architecture</span>, you can only add maps from the surveillance system server you logged in to. <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.FedArch variable">Milestone Federated Architecture</span> is a system setup with related but physically separate surveillance systems. Such a setup can be relevant for, for example, chains of shops with many separate—but related—surveillance systems.</p>
