        <h2>Alarms (explained)<a name="SC_AboutAlarms.htm"></a></h2>
        <div>
          <p class="note">This feature is only available in certain <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.XP variable">XProtect</span> VMS systems. For information about the features in your system, see <a href="../../standard_features/sf_sc/sf_considerationsrequirements/sc_surveillancesystemdif.htm" class="MCXref xref">Surveillance system differences</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>On the <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.XP variable">XProtect</span> VMS server, virtually any kind of incident or technical problem - events - can be set up to trigger an alarm. Alarms and events can all be viewed on the <span class="uitext">Alarm Manager</span> tab, which provides a central overview of your VMS incidents, status, and possible technical problems.</p>
        <p>You cannot set up alarm triggers in the <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SC_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client</span>. Your system administrator does this when configuring the <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.XP variable">XProtect</span> VMS system.</p>
        <p class="note">The <span class="uitext">Alarm Manager</span> tab is either displayed or hidden depending on the settings defined by your system administrator.</p>
        <p>The <span class="uitext">Alarm Manager</span> tab provides a dedicated view for your alarm or event handling. The tab itself displays the number of active alarms. More than nine alarms are  shown with a <img src="../../../Images/about_alarms.png" alt="9+ alarms" />. The <span class="uitext">Alarm Manager</span> tab includes an alarm list, an alarm preview for previewing video associated with individual alarms or events, and possibly also a map that displays the geographical location of the camera associated with the alarm. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Alarm list (explained)<a name="SC_TheAlarmList.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>The <span class="uitext">Alarm List</span> displays incoming alarms by default, with the most recent alarms at the top of the list. Alternatively, the alarm list can display a list of <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Glossary.Term17">MIP<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Short for "Milestone Integration Platform".</span></a> plug-in and analytic events, for example, access control or license plate recognition. </p>
        <p>Alarms or events with associated video are displayed with an icon <img src="../../../Images/sc_alarmorevent_withvideo_icon.png" alt="" />. To preview a still image from the time of the alarm or event, hover over the icon. To preview recorded video from the camera or cameras associated with the alarm or event, select the alarm or event in the list. To stop a repeating alarm sound, select the alarm associated with the sound in the list.</p>
        <p>You can decide how you want the list to appear, you can filter the columns, you can drag the columns to different positions, and you can right-click to show or hide certain columns.</p>
        <p class="note">The event list does not display system- or user-generated events, such as motion detection or archive failure.</p>
        <p>The list is updated every 3 seconds.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Servers in alarm list (explained)<a name="SC_Servers.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>On the left-hand side of the alarm list, you can view the servers that the alarms originate from. Many <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.XP variable">XProtect</span> VMS systems only have a single server, but some systems may consist of several servers in a hierarchy. All the servers you have access to are listed, and you can filter alarms by servers.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Alarm states (explained)<a name="SC_Filters.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>Alarms can be in one of the following states: New, In progress, On hold, or Closed. You can see the state of each alarm in the <span class="uitext">Alarm List</span>, in the <span class="uitext">State Name</span> column. The <span class="uitext">Filters</span> pane lets you filter according to certain criteria. Initially, all alarms will be in the <span class="uitext">New</span> state, but when an alarm is being handled, its state is updated.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Filter alarms<a name="SC_FilterAlarms.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>There are several ways you can filter the alarm list, so it displays just the alarms or events that you are interested in.</p>
        <p>Steps: </p>
        <ol>
          <li value="1">
            <p>In the toolbar of the alarm list, click the <span class="uitext">Custom (filter applied)</span> or <span class="uitext">No filter</span> text. The text may differ depending on the filter selected.<br /></p>

            </p>
          </li>
          <li value="2">Enter filter criteria on any of the columns you want to filter on. For example, if you enter a user ID in the <span class="uitext">ID</span> field, the list will only display alarms assigned to that particular user.</li>
          <li value="3">You can combine filters, for example <span class="uitext">State name</span> and <span class="uitext">Owner</span> (assigned to).</li>
          <li value="4">To return to the unfiltered alarm list, click the <span class="uitext">Clear filter</span> button.</li>
          <li value="5">To sort the content of the alarm list, click the title of the column.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="tip">If your alarm handling views contain map content, you can also filter the alarm list by right-clicking an element (camera, server, or similar) on the map, then selecting <span class="uitext">Show alarms</span>. This will make the alarm list show only alarms from the selected element.</p>

          <p>When you have received an alarm, you can acknowledge it to record that you will do something about it.</p>
          <p>Steps:</p>
          <ol>

              <p>In the alarm list, right-click the alarm and select <span class="uitext">Acknowledge</span>. The alarm state changes to <span class="uitext">In progress</span>.</p>

            <a name="Disable"></a>Disable all new alarms on selected event types</h3>
          <p>If an event is triggering false alarms, you might want to disable all new alarms on this type of event for some time.</p>
          <p>For example, if there is a lot of movement around a camera and this is causing several false alarms, you can disable alarms on motion detection for this camera for 10 minutes. Then, motion detection for the camera will not trigger alarms for 10 minutes. This way, false alarms will not disturb you, and you can focus on the alarms that need your attention.</p>
          <p class="important">Disabling alarms affects all operators who are connected to the <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.XP variable">XProtect</span> VMS system that you are also connected to. </p>
          <p>You can disable all new alarms using the <span class="uitext">Alarm Manager</span> or a map.</p>

            <li value="1">
              <p>Using the <span class="uitext">Alarm Manager</span>: in the alarm list, right-click an alarm and select <span class="uitext">Disable all new alarms</span>.</p>

For example, if a camera is being repaired and therefore disconnected, you might want to ignore the error showing up on the map during the repair.

        <p>The <span class="uitext">Alarm Report</span> window shows two graphs that display the number of alarms filtered by categories, for example <span class="uitext">Priority</span> or <span class="uitext">State</span>, allowing you to compare the two graphs side by side. </p>
        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li value="1">In the <span class="uitext">Alarm List</span>, click the <span class="uitext">Reports</span> button. A window appears.</li>
          <li value="2">Above the graphs, select the timespan, for example <span class="uitext">Last 24 hours</span>. </li>
          <li value="3">In the <span class="uitext">Select report</span> list, select one of these categories:<ul><li><span class="uitext">Category</span></li><li><span class="uitext">State</span></li><li><span class="uitext">Priority</span></li><li><span class="uitext">Reasons for closing</span></li><li><span class="uitext">Site</span></li><li><span class="uitext">Response time</span></li></ul></li>
          <li value="4">For each graph, select a sub-filter. For example if you selected <span class="uitext">State</span>, you can select <span class="uitext">New</span> in the first graph and <span class="uitext">In progress</span> in the second. The graphs are populated.</li>

        <h2>Alarms on maps (explained)<a name="SC_AlarmsOnMaps.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>If your alarm handling view contains one or more map positions, you can view alarms on the maps too. Maps display alarms based on the geographical location of the camera, server or other device triggering the alarms, so you can instantly see where the alarm originates from. You can right-click and acknowledge, disable, or suppress the alarm directly from the map.</p>
        <p>Camera elements display video in thumbnail format when you move your mouse over it. When used together with alarms, the graphical elements on maps display red circles around them if alarms occur. For example, if an alarm associated with a particular camera occurs, the graphical element representing that camera will immediately get a red circle around it, and you can then click the camera element and not only view video from the camera, but also handle the alarm through a menu that appears.</p>
        <p class="tip">If red is not an ideal color for signifying alarms on your maps, you can change this color.</p>
        <p>Now, say the camera which has an alarm associated with it, is located on a street level map, but you are viewing a city level map. How will you then notice the alarm? No problem, thanks to hot zones—graphical representations linking different map hierarchy levels together. If an alarm is detected on the street level map, the hot zone on the city level map will then turn red, indicating that there is an alarm on a lower level map—even if there are map levels in between.</p>
        <p>To return to an alarm list mode where you can see alarms from more than just the one element, click the required server, priority or state in the alarm list.</p>

        <p>Smart map displays alarms if they are triggered by a device and if the device is added to the smart map. See also <a href="../ff_map/sc_configuringmaps.htm#SC_AddingDeletingOrEditi_1.htm" class="MCXref xref">Adding, deleting, or editing devices on smart map</a>.</p>

        <h2>Events (explained)<a name="SC_Events.htm"></a></h2>
        <p>An event is a predefined incident on the <span class="mc-variable flvar-brand-company.XP variable">XProtect</span> VMS system that can be set up to trigger an alarm. Events are either predefined system incidents or user-defined events, for example analytics events or generic events. Events are not necessarily linked to an alarm, but they can be.</p>
        <p>Typically, events are activated automatically and in the background, for example, as a result of input from external sensors, detected motion or by data from other applications. However, events can also be manually activated. Events are used by the  VMS system to trigger actions, such as starting or stopping recording, changing video settings, activating <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Glossary.Term33">output<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Data going out of a computer. On IP surveillance systems, output is frequently used for activating devices such as gates, sirens, strobe lights, and more.</span></a>, or combinations of actions. When you activate an event from your <span class="mc-variable flvar-product.SC_XP variable">XProtect Smart Client</span>, it automatically triggers actions on the VMS system, for example recording on a particular camera with a particular <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open glossaryTerm glossaryTermPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup" glossTerm="Glossary.Term14">frame rate<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A measure indicating the amount of information contained in motion video. Typically measured in FPS (Frames Per second).</span></a> for a particular period of time.</p>
        <p>Your system administrator determines what happens when you manually activate an event. </p>
